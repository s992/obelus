## general instructions

- follow industry-standard best practices in all cases. if there's a reason to diverge from them, ask for guidance
- code should follow established standards in the repository unless they conflict with industry-standard best practices. if there is a conflict between what exists in the codebase and what we consider an industry-standard best practice, ask for guidance
- unless otherwise instructed: after making changes, do not give me a command to run to test your changes. run the command yourself and verify it works
- do not do "whatever it takes" to complete your task. if there's an issue with the design, you don't know how to do it, etc.: stop and ask for guidance. consider the *intent* of the request rather than striving to get a green checkmark (or whatever)
- prefer third party libraries (if a feasible one is available) over writing something from scratch

## testing strategy

- tests must be relevant and useful
- you may only skip writing tests if there are not any relevant/useful tests that can be written for your changes

## commit instructions

- all commit messages must be prefixed with "ai slop: "
- *never* bypass pre-commit hooks

## validation

prior to any commit, verify that each of the following passes:

- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run lint`
- `pnpm run test`
- `pnpm run build`
