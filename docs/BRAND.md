# Obelus — Design System & Brand Guide

## 1. What Obelus *is*
Obelus is a **private, critical reading record**.

It is not social-first.  
It is not enthusiastic.  
It does not try to motivate or reward.

It exists to **preserve judgment**.

If a design choice makes the interface feel:
- quieter → good  
- more deliberate → good  
- more serious → good  

If it feels:
- playful  
- trendy  
- motivational  
- feed-like  

it is wrong.

---

## 2. Emotional tone
Obelus should feel like:
- writing in the margins of a book
- returning to notes years later
- disagreeing with your past self calmly

Keywords:  
**editorial · restrained · archival · opinionated · durable**

Avoid:  
**friendly · social · gamified · cozy · expressive**

---

## 3. Brand mark
The obelus symbol (÷) is the identity.

- It should appear as a **mark**, not a logo lockup
- Simple, flat, typographic
- Slight asymmetry is acceptable
- Never colorful, glossy, or decorative

The mark should feel like:
> “Someone left this here on purpose.”

---

## 4. Typography philosophy
Typography carries most of the brand.

### Content text
- Serif, editorial, bookish
- Comfortable for long reading
- Italics are expressive; bold is rare

Used for:
- Book titles
- Notes
- Quotes
- Long text

### Interface text
- Neutral, modern, unobtrusive
- Should disappear behind the content

Rules:
- Avoid loud hierarchy
- Emphasis is subtle
- Nothing should shout

---

## 5. Color philosophy
Color is **semantic**, not decorative.

### Default state
- Near-black text
- Off-white or very dark background
- Mostly monochrome

### When color appears
Only to indicate meaning:
- objection
- uncertainty
- annotation
- emphasis

Color should feel like:
- pencil
- ink
- marginal marks

Never:
- decorate
- brand
- energize

If removing color makes the UI better, remove it.

---

## 6. Layout & composition
- Content-first layouts
- Comfortable margins
- Space is functional, not aesthetic
- Elements should feel *placed*, not centered for balance

Avoid:
- card-heavy dashboards
- masonry grids
- infinite feeds

Prefer:
- lists
- columns
- margins
- quiet structure

---

## 7. Iconography & visual language
Icons should feel like **editorial symbols**, not app icons.

Good metaphors:
- brackets
- carets
- pilcrows
- asterisks
- ellipses

Bad metaphors:
- hearts
- stars
- trophies
- emojis
- thumbs

If an icon feels expressive or cute, remove it.

---

## 8. Judgments over ratings
Obelus values **judgment**, not scores.

Judgments should be:
- textual
- revisable
- visible over time

Example states:
- Approved
- Mixed
- Rejected
- Unfinished
- Revisit

A judgment should feel like a sentence, not a badge.

---

## 9. Notes are first-class
Notes are not comments or accessories.

They are:
- the primary artifact
- preserved
- revisable
- allowed to contradict past notes

Notes may be:
- neutral
- critical
- uncertain
- incomplete

The UI should treat notes with **respect and gravity**.

---

## 10. Voice & language
Language should be:
- calm
- precise
- unemotional
- lightly dry

Good phrases:
- “Marked for reconsideration”
- “Judgment revised”
- “Note added”
- “Unfinished”

Bad phrases:
- “You’ll love this”
- “Great choice!”
- “Popular”
- “Trending”

The app never cheers.

---

## 11. Time & permanence
Obelus assumes:
- rereading happens
- opinions change
- history matters

Design should:
- show revision without shame
- preserve earlier judgments
- avoid erasing past states

Nothing should feel temporary or disposable.

---

## 12. North star
When uncertain, choose the option that feels:

> **More like an editor’s tool than a social product.**

That is always the correct choice.
